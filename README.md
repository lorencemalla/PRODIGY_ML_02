Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

To segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using K-Means Clustering. This helps businesses understand and target customer segments more effectively (e.g., high spenders, frequent shoppers, etc.).

Libraries Used:-
1. pandas, numpy: For data handling
2. matplotlib, seaborn: For visualization
3. scikit-learn: For scaling, clustering (KMeans), and dimensionality reduction (PCA)

Significance:-
1. K-Means helps discover natural groupings in customer data.
2. Businesses can create targeted marketing strategies (e.g., VIP, budget, loyal customers).
3. Visualizations help make data-driven decisions more intuitive.
